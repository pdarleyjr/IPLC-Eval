Feeding & Swallowing Evaluation Protocol

The Feeding and Swallowing Evaluation is a comprehensive assessment designed to identify challenges related to feeding and swallowing in children. The evaluation examines oral-motor, sensory, behavioral, and environmental factors that may impact a child's ability to eat and drink safely, effectively, and efficiently. This process involves both clinical observations and caregiver input to create an individualized plan of care. The protocol provides a structured approach to evaluate key components of feeding and swallowing to determine specific areas of concern, guide intervention planning, and ensure collaborative efforts between the clinician, family, and other professionals.

Formal and informal measures performed during the evaluation included the following:
☐ Collection of Relevant Background Information
☐ Structure/Function of Oral Motor Mechanism
☐ Observation of Feeding
☐ Mealtime Response

Structure/Function of Oral Motor Mechanism

This portion of the evaluation examines the physical structures (e.g., lips, tongue, cheeks, jaw, dentition) and their functional abilities to support safe and effective feeding and swallowing. The clinician observed the child's oral structures for symmetry, tone, and strength and assessed their ability to perform movements required for feeding, such as closing the lips, moving the tongue, and chewing. This assessment helps identify any physical or functional challenges that may contribute to feeding difficulties, such as weak muscles, restricted movement, or poor coordination. Understanding the child's oral mechanism is essential to creating an effective intervention plan tailored to their specific needs. The following observations were made:

 ☐ adequate closure ☐ weak or incomplete closure Lips -

Observation of Feeding

The observation of feeding portion of the evaluation involves observation during a typical feeding session to assess eating, drinking, and interaction with food. Various factors are observed including the feeding environment, seating, positioning, feeding duration, and the types of utensils and foods used. The ability to handle liquids and solids was assessed by offering a variety of textures and observing skills, such as biting, chewing, swallowing, and managing food or liquids in the mouth. This observation helps identify any challenges related to oral-motor skills, sensory responses, or behavioral patterns that may impact feeding. The information gathered guides the development of personalized 


strategies and recommendations to support the feeding progress. The following observations were made:

Mealtime Response 

Mealtime response evaluates overall reactions to feeding, including sensory, behavioral, and physical responses during the evaluation. Sensory responses, such as tolerating different textures, temperatures, or smells, were observed to understand preferences or aversions. Behavioral responses, such as willingness to try new foods, refusal patterns, or other mealtime behaviors, were also noted. Additionally, physical responses to feeding, including any signs of discomfort, distress, or changes in respiratory function, were assessed to ensure safe and effective feeding. These observations provide valuable insight into factors influencing mealtime success. The following observations were made:

Physical Response - 
☐ within normal limits/unremarkable
☐ changes in respiratory function (e.g., coughing, choking, wheezing)
☐ vomiting during or after feeding
☐ gagging during feeding 
☐ difficulty maintaining posture during feeding
☐ other signs of distress (e.g., facial grimacing, tearing up):

Sensory Response - 
☐ within normal limits/unremarkable
☐ avoids/rejects visually presented food
☐ tolerates undesired food on plate

☐ avoids/refuses mixed textures (e.g., soup with chunks, yogurt with fruit) 
FORMCH☐EC shows preference for specific food temperature
