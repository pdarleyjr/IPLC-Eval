Name: Ayla Dayalan 			  Evaluation Date: November 8, 2022
Date of Birth: September 18, 2019			
Age: 3 years, 1 month


Relevant Background Information

Ayla, a 3-year, 1-month-old female was seen for an initial speech-language evaluation at Riviera Schools on November 8, 2022. Ayla currently attends Riviera Schools and is in a Pre-K 3 classroom. The evaluation was scheduled following a speech-language screening conducted on October 11, 2022 with Speech Pathology and Educational Center, inc. Results from the screening indicated a need for further evaluation in order to obtain additional information in the areas of articulation and language. 

Instrumentation

Formal and informal measures performed during the evaluation included the following: 
* Preschool Language Scale - Fifth Edition (PLS-5) 
* Social Behavioral Observation
* Oral-Peripheral Examination
* Articulation/ Phonology
* Speech-Language Sample

All measures were performed in English. Results of all formal and informal assessments appear to be reliable. 

Outcome of Evaluation

The Preschool Language Scale Edition - 5th Edition (PLS-5) - a standardized assessment of receptive and expressive language skills was administered in order to assess overall language skills. The PLS-5 is designed for children from birth through seven years, eleven months of age. It evaluates all aspects of an individual's oral language and language comprehension through the use of pictures, manipulatives and observation. The test is comprised of two subscales, auditory comprehension and expressive communication.  These subscales are used to evaluate how much language a child understands and how well they communicate with others.

Standard scores are based on a scale with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of +/- 15. The following interpretation of standard scores is applicable:

Standard Score RangeInterpretationAbove 115Above Average85-115Average/ Within Normal Limits78-84Marginal/Below Average/Mild71-77Low Range/Moderate70-50Very low range/Severe50 and belowProfound

The following results were yielded:
SubtestsStandard ScoreConfidence IntervalPercentile RankAge EquivalentSeverityAuditory Comprehension9184-10027%2-11Grossly Within Normal LimitsExpressive Communication9286-9930%2-10Grossly Within Normal LimitsTotal Language Score9185-9827%2-11Grossly Within Normal Limits 

Auditory Comprehension - On the receptive portion of the PLS-5, Ayla obtained a standard score of 91, yielding an age equivalent of 2 years, 11 months. Standard score is within the mean and age equivalent is 2 months below chronological age. This standard score and age equivalent yielded receptive language skills that are grossly within normal limits. Ayla demonstrated relative strength with the following receptive language tasks:
* Understanding pronouns (me, my, your)
* Following commands without gestural cues
* Engaging in symbolic play
* Understanding use of objects
* Understanding spatial concepts (in, on, out of, off) without gestural cues. 
* Understanding quantitative concepts (one, some, rest, all)
* Making inferences
* Understanding analogies
* Understanding negatives in sentences
* Identifying colors

However, Ayala demonstrated difficulty with the following receptive language task expected of a child her age:
* Recognizing actions in pictures

Expressive Communication - On the expressive portion of the PLS-5, Ayla obtained a standard score of 92, yielding an age equivalent of 2 year, 10 months. Standard score is 2 within the mean and age equivalent 3 months below chronological age. This standard score and age equivalent yielded expressive language skills that are grossly within normal limits. Ayla demonstrated relative strength with the following expressive language tasks:
* Naming objects in photographs
* Using words more often than gestures to communicate 
* Using words for a variety of pragmatic functions
* Using different word combinations
* Naming a variety of pictured objects 
* Combining 3-4 words in spontaneous speech (e.g. "I have pink scissors")
* Using a variety of nouns, verbs, modifiers, and pronouns in spontaneous speech.
* Producing 4-5 word sentences (e.g. "I have a teddy bear on my bed.")
* Using present progressive (verb + -ing)
* Using plurals

Total Language - Ayla's total language scores revealed a standard score of 91, and an age equivalent of 2 year, 11 months. 

Social Behavioral Observation - Observation was used to assess behavioral components in various structured and unstructured activities throughout the course of the evaluation. The following social behavioral observations were noted: 

Ayla, left classroom with clinicians independently. She demonstrated appropriate response to name, joint attention, eye contact, and communicative intent. In addition, play skills and use of social language were observed to be appropriate. Ayla demonstrated appropriate attention to tasks. Throughout the course of the evaluation, Ayla was able to perform all tasks and interacted well with the clinician.

Oral Peripheral Observation - Informal assessment of the oral speech mechanism was performed through observation to assess the adequacy of the structures and functions of the oral-motor mechanism. No gross structural asymmetries or abnormalities were noted. It should be noted that Ayla demonstrated open mouth posture with some saliva around corners of mouth. However, it appeared to be secondary to congestion and reported recent cold. At this time, oral structure and function of the oral peripheral speech mechanism was observed to be adequate for speech production.  

Articulation/Phonology - The ability to produce speech sounds was assessed throughout the course of the evaluation in order to measure articulation of sounds and determine types of misarticulation. Spontaneous speech was elicited both in words and connected speech. Some inconsistent distortions, deletions, substitutions, and unintelligible utterances were noted in sequenced movements in spontaneous speech. Better productions of 1-4 syllable words/utterances with simple movements was noted. Additionally, length and complexity of movements required to articulate the word and/or utterance may have contributed to unintelligibility. 

Ayla's speech in spontaneous conversation was judged to be decodable by using context of the setting and gestures. Ayla intelligibility was judged to be fair in connected speech, she was understood to an unfamiliar listener approximately 70%-80% of the time. By the age of 3, Ayla's intelligibility at the conversational level should be 75% for an unfamiliar listener. Therefore, articulation skills were judged to be grossly within normal limits for Ayla's chronological age.

Speech-Language Sample - A speech-language sample was obtained in order to evaluate spontaneous speech and obtain more information about Ayla's language skills in a less structured environment while playing with toys that were in the treatment room.  A language sample can help identify the types of language behaviors in a child's repertoire and provides an enhanced overview of language development. The language sample was collected informally through play and observed for semantic, syntactic, morphological and pragmatic language abilities using the Preschool Language Scale (PLS-5) Language Sample Checklist. The following was observed:

Ayla's language structure of 2-5 word sentences (e.g. "This not black", "I have pink scissors", with the use of expanded sentences and more complex sentences (e.g. ""I have teddy bear on my bed", "Nikash, he watches paw patrol and spider web"). The use of various age appropriate tense markers, pronouns, plurals, possessive markers, articles, and negatives were observed. However, they were not used consistently. Additionally, Ayla was observed to use inconsistently wh- questions and yes/no questions. 

Ayla's language content consisted of naming objects, using action words, using words to denote possession, denote recurrence, describe objects and people, and give reason. It should be noted that, at times, Ayla demonstrated age appropriate word finding difficulties in the area of language structure and content. 

Social language use consisted of using words to direct attention, talk about what she was doing, name an object, answer when talked to, and interact with another person.
Connected speech was judged to be appropriately organized for Ayla's chronological age. Speech intelligibility was found to be fair with some instances of poor intelligibility, depending on the length and complexity of the utterance Ayla was trying to use. Additionally, during self play, a lot of jargon was observed.  

Overall, information obtained from the speech-language sample revealed that Ayla's language skills in conversation were consistent with results obtained from the administration of the PLS-5. However, speech-language sample revealed that Ayla demonstrated some jargon in open ended conversation, as well as, decreased articulation, as length and complexity of utterances increased.

Impressions

Based on the results of formal and informal assessment, as well as parent interview and clinical observation, Ayla, a 3-year, 1-month old female presents with speech-language skills that are developing grossly within normal limits. However, given the fact that Ayla is significantly younger than the peers in the classroom environment she is currently enrolled in, language expectations are higher than Ayla's current language age equivalent. Therefore, speech-language intervention would be beneficial at this time in order to increase Ayla's participation and confidence within the classroom setting.

Finally, it is important to note that the younger a child is assessed, the less predictive test results are of later performance. Therefore, longer-term impressions about Ayla's development potential based on these test results cannot be made at this time. The results of this assessment should be interpreted in terms of relative strengths and weakness so that they may be addressed through early intervention. Future assessments may yield different results. These results may be higher or lower due to a variety of intervening factors. Based on the results from this evaluation, Ayla's age, family support and adherence to recommendations that follow, prognosis for improved communication skills is favorable.

Recommendations

The above-mentioned results were discussed with Ayla's mom. Although, speech-language intervention is not necessary at this time, it was agreed upon in order to aid with increasing Ayla's participation and confidence within Pre-K 3 classroom. 

Based on the information obtained throughout the assessment tools and parent interview, the following recommendations are made:

1. Individual speech-language therapy 2 times a week for 30 minutes.
2. Goals should be reviewed and updated monthly and a re-evaluation is recommended in 6 months to evaluate progress.
3. Continue to monitor articulation.
4. Referral to ENT. 
5. Implement at home activities focusing on goals targeted in therapy.
6. Continued school attendance in the least restrictive environment.

It has been a pleasure meeting and working with Ayla and her family. If you have any questions and/or concerns feel free to contact me directly via telephone at (786) 622-2353 or via email at info@iplcmiami.com.
