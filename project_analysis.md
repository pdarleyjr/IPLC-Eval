# IPLC Evaluation Project Analysis

## 1. Identified Issues

### A. Tab Content & Data Entry Fields
- **Missing or Incomplete Tabs:**
  - Instrumentation tab is empty.
  - Outcome tab is empty.
  - Impressions tab is empty.
  - Recommendations tab is empty.
- **Client Info tab contains placeholder content.**
- **Background tab is not displaying properly.**
- **Dropdowns are not populating with options.**
- **'Other' options are not functioning correctly.**

### B. Functionality & Interactivity
- **Form validation is not triggering.**
- **Auto-save functionality is not working.**
- **Form submission handling is missing.**
- **Tab switching functionality needs testing.**

### C. UI/UX & Aesthetic Issues
- **Matte gradient pastel colors need refinement.**
- **Noise and texture overlays need better integration.**
- **Hover animations and micro-interactions need improvement.**
- **Mobile responsiveness needs testing and optimization.**

## 2. Corrective Action Plan

### A. Tab Content Implementation
- Populate the Instrumentation, Outcome, Impressions, and Recommendations tabs with data entry fields from the provided templates.
- Ensure all fields are correctly categorized and structured.

### B. Form Functionality Fixes
- Implement proper dropdown population in `main.js`.
- Fix 'Other' options to display text input when selected.
- Ensure form validation triggers correctly.
- Fix auto-save functionality.
- Implement form submission handling.

### C. UI/UX Enhancements
- Refine the color scheme to better match IPLC branding.
- Improve noise and texture overlays for better depth.
- Enhance hover animations and micro-interactions.
- Optimize mobile responsiveness.

### D. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Test all form fields and dropdowns.
- Validate tab switching functionality.
- Ensure form validation and auto-save work correctly.
- Conduct UI/UX testing for responsiveness and accessibility.

## 3. Next Steps
1. Implement the corrective actions in Code mode.
2. Conduct thorough quality assurance in QA mode.
